## 🧭 About Me

I’m a **Site Reliability Engineer** with a **Computer Science background**, working close to the heart of production systems.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- backend engineering  
- platform design  
- reliability & operations  

I care deeply about **how systems behave over time**, not just how fast they ship.

I value:
- clear ownership
- explicit contracts
- designs that explain themselves when something breaks

<br/>

## 🧠 How I Think About Systems

```text
Architecture before tools
Contracts before assumptions
Ownership before convenience
Reliability before velocity
Clarity over cleverness
```

Good systems don’t need heroes.  
They create space for teams to work safely.

## 🔭 What I’m Building

I’m currently building **Nivak** — a real, multi-tenant HOA platform — to grow as a backend engineer and system architect.

**Focus areas:**
- Go + gRPC microservices
- Strict service and data ownership
- Tenant-aware system design
- Kubernetes-first deployment
- Observability as a baseline, not an afterthought

This is not a demo project.  
It’s a deliberate exercise in **building things correctly**.

_If you care about building systems that last,  
we’ll probably have a good conversation._
