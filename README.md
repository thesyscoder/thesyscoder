# Hi — I'm TheSysCoder 👋

A design-forward software engineer building clean developer tools and delightful web experiences. This README is pure Markdown (no raw HTML) and uses simple image assets and emoji so it renders nicely on GitHub.

## Illustration & icons

I included two ready SVG motifs in the `assets/` folder you can reference in this README:

- `assets/hero-abstract.svg` — geometric / abstract hero (used above)
- `assets/deer-wireframe.svg` — stylized deer wireframe for case studies or sections

To use a different motif or a double‑exposure portrait:
1. Create or export a raster hero image (PNG/WebP) showing the double‑exposure effect (Photoshop / Photopea).
2. Commit it to `assets/` and update the image link above: `![Hero illustration](./assets/your-hero.png)`

Notes:
- GitHub renders SVG images referenced from the repository (e.g. `![...](./assets/hero-abstract.svg)`).
- Avoid inline HTML for layout because some renderers sanitize it — using Markdown + images keeps things portable.

## How to customize quickly

1. Replace the image file at `assets/hero-abstract.svg` with your preferred SVG or a raster image at `assets/hero.png`.
2. Edit the top lines (intro, highlights, project links) in this README to match your personal copy.
3. Commit & push.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a monochrome double‑exposure PNG for you if you attach a portrait + texture image.
- Replace the hero SVG here with a colored variant (tell me the palette).
- Add small SVG icon files for the "Full‑stack / Systems / Scripting" lines and show how to reference them inline.

Thank you — pick one: "deer" / "double-exposure portrait" / "geometric", and whether you want monochrome or colored. I’ll generate the final SVG/PNG and the exact README update.
